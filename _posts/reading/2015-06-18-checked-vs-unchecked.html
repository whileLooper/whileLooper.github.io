<p>Checked and Unchecked exception are two types of Exceptions in Java, actually there is no functionality differences, but there is some different on exception handling.</p>

<p>1) Checked Exception is required to be handled by compile time while Unchecked Exception doesn't.</p>
<p>2) Checked Exception is direct sub-Class of Exception while Unchecked Exception are of RuntimeException.</p>
<p>3) Checked Exception represent scenario with higher failure rate while UnChecked Exception are mostly programming mistakes.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Checked Exception </strong>in Java is all those Exception which requires being catches and handled during <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-is-static-and-dynamic-binding-in.html">compile time</a>. If Compiler doesn't see try or catch block handling a Checked Exception, it throws Compilation error.</p>
<p>All the Exception which are direct <strong>subclass</strong> of Exception but not inherit <strong>RuntimeException</strong> are Checked Exception.</p></blockquote>

<h4><u>When to use Checked Exception in Java</u></h4>
<p>Knowing <strong>Checked Exception</strong> is not that useful until you know how to use Checked Exception in Java. Java has often been criticized for its Checked Exception strategy, arguments given are that checked Exception adds lot of boiler plate code and makes whole class or function unreadable. Somewhat I agree with this and java also recognize this by introducing <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/07/jdk7-multi-cache-block-example-tutorial.html">improved Exception handling mechanism in Java7</a> but Checked Exception does have its real purpose. Following are some scenarios where I would prefer to use Checked Exception to ensure that <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-to-write-production-quality-code.html">Code is Robust and stable</a>:</p>
<p>1) All Operation where chances of failure is more e.g. IO Operation, Database Access or Networking operation can be handled with Checked Exception.</p>
<p>2) When you know what to do (i.e. you have alternative) when an Exception occurs, may be as part of Business Process.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Checked Exception</strong> is a reminder by compiler to programmer to handle failure scenario.</p>
<h4><u>Example of checked Exception in Java API</u><br />
IOException， <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/01/javasqlsqlexception-invalid-column.html">SQLException</a>， DataAccessException，<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/08/classnotfoundexception-in-java-example.html">ClassNotFoundException</a>，InvocationTargetException</h4>
<h4><u>What is Unchecked Exception in Java?</u></h4>
<p><strong>Unchecked Exception in Java</strong> is those Exceptions whose handling is not verified during Compile time. Unchecked Exceptions mostly arise due to programming errors like accessing method of a null object, accessing element outside an array bonding or invoking method with illegal arguments. In Java, Unchecked Exception is direct sub Class of RuntimeException. <em>What is major benefit of Unchecked Exception</em> is that it doesn't reduce code readability and keeps the client code clean.</p>
<h4><u>When to use UnCheckedException in Java</u></h4>
<p>A good strategy of <strong>Exception handling in Java</strong> is wrapping a checked Exception into <strong>UnCheckedException</strong>. Since most of <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/11/database-transaction-tutorial-example.html">Database operation</a> throws SQLException but it’s not good to let SQLException propagate from your DAO layer to up higher on business layer and client code provide exception handling you can handle SQLException in DAO layer and you can wrap the cause in a RuntimeException to propagate through client code. Also as I said earlier unchecked exceptions are mostly programming errors and to catch them is real hard until you do a load test with all possible input and scenario.</p>
