<p>Use interface for type declaration, use abstract class if evolution is concern</p>
<br>
<blockquote><p>1) Interface in Java can only contains declaration. You can not declare any concrete methods inside interface. On the other hand abstract class may contain both abstract and concrete methods, which makes abstract class an ideal place to provide common or default functionality. I suggest reading my post <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/04/10-points-on-interface-in-java-with.html">10 things to know about interface in Java</a> to know more about interfaces, particularly in Java programming language.</p>
<p>2) Java interface can extend multiple interface also Java class can implement multiple interfaces, Which means interface can provide more Polymorphism support than abstract class . By extending abstract class, a class can only participate in one Type hierarchy but by using interface it can be part of multiple type hierarchies. E.g. a class can be Runnable and Displayable at same time. One example I can remember of this is writing GUI application in J2ME, whereÂ  class extends Canvas and implements CommandListener to provide both graphic and event-handling functionality..</p>
<p>3) In order to implement interface in Java, until your class is abstract, you need to provide implementation of all methods, which is very painful. On the other hand abstract class may help you in this case by providing default implementation. Because of this reason, I prefer to have minimum methods in interface, starting from just one, I don't like idea of <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/01/what-is-marker-interfaces-in-java-and.html">marker interface</a>, once annotation is introduced in Java 5. If you look JDK or any framework like Spring, which I does to understand OOPS and design patter better, you will find that most of interface contains only one or two methods e.g. Runnable, Callable, ActionListener etc.</p>
