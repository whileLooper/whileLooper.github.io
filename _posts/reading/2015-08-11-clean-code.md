> Learning to wirte clean code is **hard work**. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must **swear** over it. You must *pratice* it yourself, and *watch yourself fail*. You must watch others practice it and fail. You muse see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions the wrong way.
