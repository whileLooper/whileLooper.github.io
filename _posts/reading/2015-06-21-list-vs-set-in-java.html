<p>Both of them are used to store objects and provides convenient API to insert, remove and retrieve elements, along with to support iteration over collection.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Fundamental difference between List and Set in Java is allowing duplicate element. Lis is allowing duplicate while Set <strong>doesn't allow</strong><strong> duplicate</strong>. Set will replace the older value, any element in Set is unique.</p>
<p>2. List is an o<strong>rdered collection</strong> while Set is an <b>unordered collection</b>. List maintains insertion order of element. Set provides another alternative called SortedSet which can store Set element in specific sorting order.</p>
<p>3. Set uses <b>equals() </b>method to check uniqueness of element, while SortedSet uses <strong>compareTo()</strong> method.</p>
<p>4. Popular implementation of List interface in Java includes <strong>ArrayList, Vector</strong> and <strong>LinkedList</strong>. While popular implementation of Set interface includes <strong>HashSet, TreeSet </strong>and <strong>LinkedHashSet</strong>.</p>
