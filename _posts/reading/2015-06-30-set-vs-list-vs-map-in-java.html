summary:	List provides ordered and indexed collection which can contains Duplicate.	Set provides an un-ordered collection of unique object, doesn't allow Duplicate.	Map provides a data structure based on key value pair and hashing.

<p>Interfaces, they are interfaces of java collection framework.</p>
<p><i>List </i>provides ordered and indexed collection which can contains Duplicate.</p>
<p><em>Set </em>provides an un-ordered collection of unique object, doesn't allow Duplicate.</p>
<p><em>Map </em>provides a data structure based on key value pair and hashing. <!--more--></p>

<h3><strong><u>When to use List, Set and Map in Java</u></strong></h3>
<p>Based upon our understanding of <em>difference between Set, List and Map</em> we can now decide when to use List, Set or Map in Java.</p>
<p>1) If you need to access elements frequently by using index, than List is a way to go. Its implementation e.g.<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/05/example-of-arraylist-in-java-tutorial.html">ArrayList</a> provides faster access if you know index.</p>
<p>2) If you want to store elements and want them to maintain an <strong>order</strong> on which they are inserted into collection then go for List again, as List is an ordered collection and maintain insertion order.</p>
<p>3) If you want to create collection of unique elements and <strong>don't want any duplicate</strong> than choose any Set implementation e.g. HashSet, LinkedHashSet or TreeSet. All Set implementation follow there general contract e.g. uniqueness but also add addition feature e.g. TreeSet is a SortedSet and elements stored on TreeSet can be sorted by using <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/06/comparator-and-comparable-in-java.html">Comparator or Comparable in Java</a>.LinkedHashSet also maintains insertion order.</p>
<p>4) If you store data in form of key and value than Map is the way to go. You can choose from Hashtable,HashMap, TreeMap based upon your subsequent need. In order to choose between first two see<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/09/difference-hashmap-vs-hashset-java.html">difference between HashSet and HashMap in Java</a>.</p>
