<p><strong>Payloads</strong> are defined in <em>modules/payloads/{singles</em>,<em>stages</em>,<em>stagers</em>}<em>/&lt;platform</em>&gt;.When the framework starts up, stages are combined with stagers to create a complete payload that you can use in exploits. Then, handlers are paired with payloads so the framework will know how to create sessions with a given communications mechanism.</p>
