<p>Five basic principles of Object-Oriented programing and design.</p>
<p>When these principles applied together, will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over times. SOLID are the guidelines that can be applied while working on software to remove code smells by causing the programmer to refactor the software's source code until it is both legible and extensible.</p>

<h5>S - SRP - Single responsibility principle</h5>
<p>a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Class (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)">class</a> should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's  specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)</p>
<h5>0 - ocp - open/closed principle</h5>
<p>“software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”</p>
<h5>L - Lsp - Liskov substitution principle</h5>
<p>“objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the       correctness of that program.”</p>
<h5>I - isp - interface segregation principle</h5>
<p>“many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”</p>
<h5>D - dip - dependency inversion principle</h5>
<p>one should “Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.”</p>
