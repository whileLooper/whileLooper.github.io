<blockquote><p>Here is list of differences between wait and sleep in Java:</p>
<p>1) Wait is called from synchronized context only while sleep can be called without synchronized block.</p>
<p>2) wait is called on Object while sleep is called on Thread.</p>
<p>3) waiting thread can be awake by calling notify and notify. All while sleeping thread can not be awaken by calling notify method.</p>
<p>4) wait is normally done on condition, Thread wait until a condition is true while sleep is just to put your thread on sleep.</p>
<p>5) wait release lock on object while waiting while sleep doesn’t release lock while waiting.</p></blockquote>
