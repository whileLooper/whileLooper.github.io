summary: Synchronization works with "Locks",When we enter synchronized method, we automatically acquire the lock associated with the current instance of the class whose code we are executing.

<p>Synchronization works with "Locks", every java objects has a built-in lock that only comes into play when the object has synchronized method code. When we enter synchronized method, we automatically acquire the lock associated with the current instance of the class whose code we are executing.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Acquiring a lock for an object is also known as getting the lock or locking the object, synchronizing on the object.</p>
<p>Since there is only one lock per object, if one thread has picked up the lock, no other thread can pick up the lock until the first thread releases or returns the lock. This means no other thread can enter the synchronized code until the lock has been released.</p>
<p>Typically, releasing a lock means the thread holding the lock, in other words, the thread currently in the synchronized method exits the synchronized method. At that point, the lock is free until some other thread enters a synchronized method on that object.</p>
