<p>What is the difference between <strong>abstract</strong> class and <strong>interface</strong> in Java programming language ? and when to use interface and abstract class?</p>
<br>
<blockquote><p>1. Interface in Java can only contains declaration. Not any concrete methods inside interface. On the other hand, abstract class may contain both abstract and concrete methods, which make abstract class an ideal place to provide common or default functionality.</p>
<p>2. Java interface can extend multiple interface also Java class can implement multiple interface, which means interface can provide more Polymorphism support than class. By extending abstract class, a class can only participate in one Type hierarchy but by using interface it can be part of multiple type hierarchies.</p>
<p>3. In order to implement interface in Java, until your class is abstract, you need to provide implementation of all methods, which is very painful. On the other hand abstract class may help in this case by providing default implementation.</p>
<h5>When to use interface and abstract class in Java</h5>
<p>1) In Java particularly, decision between choosing Abstract class and interface may influence by the fact that multiple inheritance is not supported in Java. One class can only extend another class in Java. If you choose abstract class over interface than you lost your chance to extend another class, while at the same time you can implement multiple interfaces to show that you have multiple capability. One of the common example, in favor of interface over abstract class is <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/01/difference-thread-vs-runnable-interface.html">Thread vs Runnable</a> case. If you want to execute a task and need run() method it's better to implement Runnable interface than extending Thread class.</p>
<p>2) Let's see another case where an abstract class suits better than interface. Since abstract class can include concrete methods, it’s great for maintenance point of view, particularly when your base class is evolving and keep changing. If you need a functionality across all your implementation e.g. a common method, than, you need to change every single implementation to include that change if  you have chosen interface to describe your base class. Abstract class comes handy in this case because you can just define new functionality in abstract super class and every sub class will automatically gets it. In short, abstract class are great in terms of evolving functionality. If you are using interface, you need to exercise extra care while defining contracts because its not easy to change them once published.</p>
<p>3) Interface in Java is great for defining Types. Programming for interfaces than implementation is also one of the useful <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.de/2012/03/10-object-oriented-design-principles.html">Object oriented design principle</a> which suggests benefit of using interface as argument to function, return type etc.</p>
<p>4) One more general rule of when to use abstract class and interface is to find out whether a certain class will form a IS-A hierarchy or CAN-DO-THIS hierarchy. If you know that you will be creating classes e.g. Circle, Square than it's better to create an abstract class Shape which can have area() and perimeter() as abstract method, rather than defining Shape as interface in Java. On the other hand if you are going to create classes which can do thinks like, can fly, you can use interface Flyable instead of abstract class.</p>
<p>5) Interface generally define capability e.g. Runnable can run(), Callable can call(), Displayable can display(). So if you need to define capability, consider using interface. Since a class can have multiple capabilities i.e. a class can be Runnable as well as Displayable at same time. As discussed in first point, Since <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-multiple-inheritances-are-not.html">java does not allow multiple inheritance at class level</a>, only way to provide multiple capability is via interfaces.</p>
<p>6) Let's see another example of where to use Abstract class and Interface in Java, which is related to earlier point. Suppose you have lot of classes to model which are birds, which can fly, than creating a base abstract class as Bird would be appropriate  but if you have to model other things along with Birds, which can fly e.g. Airplanes, Balloons or Kites than it's better to create interface Flyable to represent flying functionality. In conclusion, if you need to provide a functionality which is used by same type of class than use Abstract class and if functionality can be used by completely unrelated classes than use interface.</p>
<p>7) Another interesting use of Abstract class and interface is defining contract using interface and providing skeletal using abstract class. java.util.List from Java collection framework is a good example of this pattern. List is declared as interface and extends Collection and Iterable interface and AbstractList is an abstract class which implements List. AbstractList provides skeletal implementation of List interface. Benefit of using this approach is that it minimize the effort to implement this interface by concrete class e.g. <a href="http://java67.blogspot.com/2012/12/difference-between-arraylist-vs-LinkedList-java.html">ArrayList or LinkedList</a>. If you don't use skeletal implementation e.g. abstract class and instead decide to implement List interface than not only you need to implement all List methods but also you might be duplicating common code. Abstract class in this case reduce effort to implement interface.</p>
<p>8) Interface also provide more decoupling than abstract class because interface doesn't contain any implementation detail, while abstract class may contain default implementation which may couple them with other class or resource.</p>
<p>9) Using interface also help while implementing <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/inversion-of-control-dependency-injection-design-pattern-spring-example-tutorial.html">Dependency Injection design pattern</a> and makes testing easy. Many mock testing framework utilize this behavior.</p>
