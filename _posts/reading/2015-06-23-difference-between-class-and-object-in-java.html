date: 2015-06-23 04:01:51
summary:	Class is a blueprint to create different objects of same types. Class and object are related to each other because every Object must be type of any class. In the same time class itself is of no use until you create object. The former one is a design and later one is actual thing.

<p><strong>Class</strong> is a blueprint to create different <strong>objects</strong> of same types. Class and object are related to each other because every Object must be type of any class. In the same time class itself is of no use until you create object. The former one is a design and later one is actual thing.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>
1. Class is blueprint means you can create different object based on one class which varies in there property. e.g. if <em>Car </em>is a class then <em>Mercedes, BMW </em>or <em>Audi</em> are objects.</p>
<p>2. A class in java contains both state and behavior, state is represented by field in class, and behavior as method in java.</p>
<p>3. Object is also called instance in Java and every instance has different values of <em>instance variables.</em> Objects are most notably created using <em>new() </em>operator, and class have a <em>class </em>keyword to declare.</p>
