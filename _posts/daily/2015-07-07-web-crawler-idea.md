Having a idea to make a web crawler to crawling Japanese manga weekly, so that I don't need to wait for manga website update.
Here is some information about web crawler tools to help archive my project, I will keep updating the progress of this web crawler. :)

- **WebCollector** is an open source web crawler framework based on Java.It provides some simple interfaces for crawling the Web,you can setup a multi-threaded web crawler in less than 5 minutes.


- **AJAX**, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is not a new programming language, but a new way to use existing standards. AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page.


- **Jsoup** is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.


- **Meet Scrapy** An open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites. In a fast, simple, yet extensible way.
