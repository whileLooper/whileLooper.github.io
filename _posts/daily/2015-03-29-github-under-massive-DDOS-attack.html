<p>Last night, GitHub was hit with a massive denial of service attack. Some time Wednesday, scripts belonging to the internet giant Baidu began directing traffic to two specific GitHub pages: one run by GreatFire, and another mirroring Chinese translations of The New York Times. The result for Github was a massive flood of traffic, which built for more than 24 hours before causing partial outages Thursday night. Server logs show a sudden drop in app server availability just before midnight, and page failure rates spiking to 100% just before 3am. Although according to admins, the attack is still ongoing, and recent tweets suggest a surge in attack volume on Friday morning.</p>
